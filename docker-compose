Docker-compose: To bring up multiple services at a time.

Each service is like one container(point of docker perspective)

docker-compose.yaml is the default compose file name.

Download Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows. Docker Compose will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of Compose.

This solution uses Python, Node.js, .NET, with Redis for messaging and Postgres for storage.
